# Misinformation detection in Social Networks using Deep Learning
This project aims to develop a machine learning framework for social information misclassification.We are using the twitter fake news dataset for training this model.

## Project Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- torch >= 1.1
- Numpy
- Torchvision
- torch_geometric
- google_drive_downloader

## Training the model
To train the model, please follow the following steps:
1. Install the project requirements by invoking the command:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the driver script using this command: `python run.py --<arg1>=<val1> --<arg2> = <val2>`
3. The argument options description can be found by running the following help command: `python run.py -h`
